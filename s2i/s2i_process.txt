#s2i needs three components:
- Source code
- s2i scripts (these scripts must be executable inside the builder image, can be written in any programming languages. Usefull for customize the build process)
- s2i builder image

#s2i scripts (inside the builder image)

assemble (mandatory) #build app from source code and place files in correct directory inside the image
run      (mandatory) #this script run the app
save-artifacts       #save dependencies for incremental builds
usage                #show image usage
test/run             #testing purpose

For overriding default s2i script, create a .s2i/bin folder in the app source code repository


the default directory for s2i script inside the builder image is : /usr/libexec/s2i
